`argc` and `argv` are command-line arguments used in C and C++ programs to pass information to the program from the command line when it is executed.

1. **`argc` (Argument Count):**

   `argc` is an integer that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to a program, including the program's name itself. It stands for "argument count."

   - The first argument, `argv[0]`, is the name of the program itself.
   - The actual command-line arguments start from `argv[1]` and continue up to `argv[argc-1]`.

2. **`argv` (Argument Vector):**

   `argv` is an array of character pointers (strings) where each element of the array points to a command-line argument. It stands for "argument vector."

   - `argv[0]` typically contains the name of the program (the first argument).
   - `argv[1]` through `argv[argc-1]` contain the actual command-line arguments.

Here's a simple example of how `argc` and `argv` are used in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // argc is the number of command-line arguments
    printf("argc: %d\n", argc);

    // argv[0] is the program name
    printf("Program name: %s\n", argv[0]);

    // Display the remaining command-line arguments
    for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

When you run this program from the command line with arguments like `./program arg1 arg2`, it will display:

```
argc: 3
Program name: ./program
Argument 1: arg1
Argument 2: arg2
```

You can use `argc` and `argv` to pass information to your program or to process command-line options and arguments as needed for your application.
